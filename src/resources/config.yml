# Note: You can also change the priority of event handlers with:
# priority, cmdpriority and signpriority
# Changing priority can allow the event handlers to process messages before or after other
# plugins.  This can sometimes help with plugin conflicts.  You really should know what you
# are doing before you change these. :)

# Change priority of PlayerListener (chat)
# chatpriority: lowest #(default)

# Change priority of CommandListener
# cmdpriority: lowest #(default)

# Change priority of SignListener
# signpriority: lowest #(default)

# Change priority of ItemListener
# itempriority: lowest
